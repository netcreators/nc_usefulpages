2013-03-05 0.4.0 Leonie Philine Bitto <leonie@netcreators.nl>
	* The plugin now distinguishes not only between pages identified by page ID, but instead takes 3rd party plugin
		parameters into account, keeping separate ratings for any given set of plugin parameters.

		NOTE I:

		ncgov_permits is not a good citizen in this respect, as it sends a 'Location' header resulting in a HTTP
		code 302 'Found' redirect, IF there are any _POST parameters set, regardless of if these parameters are within
		its own plugin controller argument namespace or not. This means that script execution is halted before the
		controller action code of other plugins on the page - e.g. of nc_usefulpages - are called. Furthermore, for the
		redirect, it builds a 'link to controller' URL which only takes its own parameters, but no 3rd party parameters
		into account. Therefore, nc_usefulpages' PageController::rateAction is never even called.

		@see tx_ncgovpermits_controller::getView() and tx_ncgovpermits_controller::getViewAll().

		NOTE II:

		We do NOT forward or store any $_POST parameters, since this could mean sending emails, ordering products
		or making appointments in other plugins *twice* or at least creating errors.

		This means that if e.g. you find the search results for a certain search term useful, then the search term will
		only be registered and a separate page rating for each search term created, if the search is using GET instead
		of POST to send its form data.

		The same applies to the view being shown after the 'Useful' or 'Not useful' button has been clicked:
		Only if e.g. a search form has been submitted using the GET method, the same search results will be shown after
		the rating has been saved. If the POST method is used, an empty search form is shown.

		If wished for by a client then we *could*, however, think about creating a 'white list' of allowed, harmless
		$_POST parameters to forward.

	* Made PageController::indexAction() non-cacheable, since it needs to flexibly hold different sets of third-party
		parameters.
	* Removed useless custom FormViewHelper.
	* Removed Page Domain Model TCA labels for context sensitive help, as they did not add any further information.
	* Added change to the ChangeLog.
	* Incremented minor version number to 0.4.0.
